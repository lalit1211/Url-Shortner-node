# Getting Started With Node.Js Url-Shortener 
This project is based on Node, Express, and MongoDB.
This is like the Bitly web app to generates a short URL.
'#Bitly Clone, #URL-Shortner'

## Available Scripts
Firstly you have to run the following command :
  1. `yarn`
  2. `npm install`
These two commands will install all the dependencies which will help to run the Project.

  And now, you have to run the project by running the command:
  1. `yarn start`
  2. `npm start`
  

## APIs 
  `Base URL- http://localhost:8000`
  1. http://localhost:8000/api/url/
      pass your original URL to this URL and you will get a short ID
     and the short id will passed as params of the below URL(API).
  3. http://localhost:8000/api/url/:shortId
      Now this URL will be treated as your short URL like `Bitly` does.
